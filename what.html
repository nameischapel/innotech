                    It does its job quite well and has a pleasant smell that doesn't give you a headache not does it render the room inhabitable after spraying. In short, it's perfect, go for it.

                    I selected this product among many! And It was a good choice!!! My plant was full of this white stuff. So, I gently removed the white stuff and sprayed every day. In just 10 days there are MANY new leaves on the plant. I feel so happy!!! Great product!!!
